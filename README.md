**Overall Structure:**

The code remains wrapped in a self-invoking function using jQuery (`$(function($) { ... })`).

**Sections:**

**1. Long Shadow Effects (`flat_long_shadow` function):**

   - **Logic Flow:**
      1. Define variables for targeted elements (`targetElement`), container element (`containerElement`), shadow length (`shadowLength`), and light offset (`lightOffset`).
      2. Loop through each `targetElement` using jQuery's `each` method.
      3. Inside the loop:
         - Extract the background color (`backgroundColor`) of the `containerElement`.
         - Calculate darker shades for the shadow based on `backgroundColor` and `lightOffset`.
         - Construct a comma-separated string (`boxShadowString`) containing the shadow values (length, offset, and color) for different positions.
         - Set the `box-shadow` CSS property of the `targetElement` using the `boxShadowString`.

**2. Sidebar Columns (`#secondary` element):**

   - **Logic Flow:**
      1. Define variables for the sidebar element (`sidebarElement`) and an empty array to store column elements (`columnElements`).
      2. Loop through each widget element within the `sidebarElement` using jQuery's `each` method.
      3. Inside the loop:
         - Based on the current element's index modulo 2 (even or odd):
            - If even, append the element to the first column (not yet defined, we'll create it dynamically).
            - If odd, append the element to the second column (not yet defined).
      4. After the loop, iterate through the `columnElements` array (which now holds references to the dynamically created column elements) and append them to the actual sidebar (`sidebarElement`).

**3. Tag Cloud Reset:**

   - **Logic Flow:**
      1. Define a variable for the tag cloud element (`tagCloudElement`).
      2. Use jQuery to select all anchor tags (`a`) within the `tagCloudElement`.
      3. Set the `style` property of these anchor tags to an empty string, effectively removing any inline styles.

**4. Content Limit (`content-limit` element):**

   - **Logic Flow:**
      1. Define variables for the content limit element (`contentLimitElement`), a running total height (`totalHeight`), and a flag to indicate content exceeding the limit (`contentOverflow`).
      2. Loop through each child element within the `contentLimitElement` using jQuery's `each` method.
      3. Inside the loop:
         - Get the height (`childHeight`) of the current child element.
         - Add `childHeight` to `totalHeight`.
         - If `totalHeight` exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 500px):
            - Set the `contentOverflow` flag to `true`.
            - Hide the current child element using jQuery's `hide` method.
         - If `contentOverflow` is `true` and the previous element exists:
            - Check the previous element's height (`previousHeight`).
            - If `previousHeight` is less than a minimum threshold (e.g., 100px) to avoid awkward cutoff, hide the previous element as well.
      4. Reset `contentOverflow` to `false` for the next iteration.

**5. Gallery Slider (`galleryslider` element):**

   - **Variables:**
      - `galleryElement`: The current gallery slider element.
      - `galleryInner`: The inner container element holding the images.
      - `galleryUl`: The unordered list element containing image list items.
      - `imageWidth`: Width of each image in the slider.
      - `currentPos`: Current position (index) of the displayed image.
      - `galleryHeight`: Height of the slider based on the current image.
   - **Logic Flow:**
      1. Loop through each `galleryslider` element using jQuery's `each` method.
      2. Inside the loop:
         - Set references to various child elements within the `galleryElement`.
         - Ensure the `galleryInner` element has overflow hidden and relative positioning for proper image scrolling.
         - Calculate the total width of all image list items based on `imageWidth`.
         - Set up smooth transition effects for image movement using `flat_gallery_transition`.
         - Style each image list item to float left and display as a block.
         - If there are less than two cloned images (for seamless looping), create and append the necessary clones.
         - Retrieve the `data-pos` attribute (current image position














# Technical documentation - world_game folder


The code you provided is written in JavaScript and appears to be for a side-scrolling game. Here's a breakdown of the code with explanations for each section:

**1. Setting up the requestAnimationFrame polyfill:**

This code ensures smooth animations across different browsers by defining a function called `requestAFrame` that utilizes the browser's built-in `requestAnimationFrame` method or a fallback implementation using `setTimeout`.

**2. Window resize and fullscreen handling:**

These event listeners (`window.onload` and `window.onresize`) are used to handle window resize events and potentially enter or exit fullscreen mode based on a `fscreen` variable.

**3. Global variables:**

Several global variables are declared, including:

- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`: Define the canvas dimensions.
- `canvas` and `ctx`: References to the HTML canvas element and its drawing context.
- `keystate`: Tracks currently pressed keyboard keys.
- `ontouch_1`: Stores touch input information (likely for mobile devices).

**4. getObjectFitSize function:**

This function calculates the appropriate size and position for an image within a container element while maintaining its aspect ratio.

**5. Main function (`main`):**

This is the main entry point of the game. It performs various tasks like:

- Setting initial values for variables related to scale, player position, score, etc.
- Accessing the canvas element and its context.
- Calculating the appropriate canvas dimensions based on the device and screen size.
- Initializing the game objects (player, bricks, coins, etc.) using the `init` function.
- Starting the game loop using `game_loop`.

**6. init function:**

This function initializes the game objects with their properties like position, size, and state. It also sets the player's starting position and other game parameters.

**7. Game loop function (`game_loop`):**

This function continuously updates the game state and renders graphics on the canvas. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

- Clears the canvas.
- Creates a background gradient based on the `hsl_h` variable (likely for a day-night cycle effect).
- Draws the score if the game is ongoing.
- Applies scaling effects based on various factors like player state.
- Updates the sun's position and color based on the `sunY`, `sunB`, and `sunC` variables (simulating sunrise/sunset).
- Iterates through and draws clouds, stars, and other game objects.
- Updates the player's position and handles collisions with other objects.
- Calls `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule the next animation frame.

**8. Other functions:**

- `left()`, `right()`, `jump()`: Likely handle player movement based on user input.
- `tapToStart()`: Initiates the game when the "Tap to Start" button is clicked.
- `setCookie` and `getCookie`: Functions for storing and retrieving data using cookies (potentially for saving game progress).

Overall, this code demonstrates the core logic behind a side-scrolling game with elements like character movement, background effects, object interactions, and a basic game loop.

Please note that this is a high-level explanation, and some parts might require further analysis based on the complete codebase. If you have specific questions about certain sections or functionalities, feel free to ask!
